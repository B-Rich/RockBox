UIDynamics / Swift Demo. 

This application programmatically adds some boxes to the screen, and ties their behavior to the accelerometer
of the phone. The result is that you can slide a bunch of boxes around the screen by playing with the orientation
of your phone.

Runs on the simulator, but it's boring. Ho-hum.
